            <h4>Best practices: Tips for keeping your antivirus software up-to-date, scheduling regular scans, and responding to malware threats effectively.</h4>
            <br>
            <details><ul>
                <li>Enable automatic updates: Most antivirus software offers an option to automatically download and install updates. Enable this feature to ensure your antivirus software stays up-to-date with the latest virus definitions and security patches.
                </li>
                <li>Check for updates regularly: If automatic updates are not enabled, make it a habit to manually check for updates regularly, at least once a week, to ensure your antivirus software is providing the best possible protection against the latest malware threats.
                </li>

            <br>
            <details><ul>
                <li>Set up scheduled scans: Schedule regular scans of your computer using your antivirus software's scheduling feature. Perform full system scans at least once a week to thoroughly check your entire system for malware infections.
                </li>
                <li>Choose optimal scan times: Schedule scans during periods when your computer is not in use, such as overnight or during weekends, to minimize disruptions to your workflow.
                </li>

            <br>
            <details><ul>
                <li>Avoid suspicious websites: Be cautious when browsing the internet and avoid visiting suspicious websites or clicking on links from unknown sources. Many malware infections occur through drive-by downloads or malicious links on compromised websites.
                </li>
                <li>Be wary of email attachments: Exercise caution when opening email attachments, especially from unknown or suspicious senders. Malware often spreads through infected email attachments, so always verify the sender's identity before opening attachments.
                </li>

            <br>
            <details><ul>
                <li>Implement a regular backup routine: Regularly back up your important files and data to an external hard drive, cloud storage service, or another secure location. In the event of a malware infection or data loss, having backups ensures you can recover your data without paying a ransom or suffering permanent loss.

            <br>
            <details><ul>
                <li>Recognize common signs of malware infection: Be alert for unusual behavior on your computer, such as slow performance, frequent crashes, unexpected pop-up ads, or changes to your browser settings. These could be signs of a malware infection that requires immediate attention.
                </li>
                <li>Monitor antivirus software alerts: Pay attention to alerts and notifications from your antivirus software. If your antivirus software detects a potential malware threat, take immediate action to quarantine or remove the threat from your system.
                </li>
            </ul><summary><span>Be Vigilant for Signs of Malware

                </li>
                <li>Run additional scans: After removing malware, run additional scans with your antivirus software to ensure all traces of malware have been eliminated from your system.
                </li>
                <li>Seek professional help if needed: If you're unable to remove malware on your own or if you suspect your computer is still infected after running scans, seek assistance from a professional IT technician or cybersecurity expert.
